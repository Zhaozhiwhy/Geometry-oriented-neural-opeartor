# Geometry-Oriented-Neural-Operator
Geometry-Oriented-Neural-Operator is a neural operator framework for solving PDEs with various domain and also parameters. 

## Dataset
The dataset used here is the stress-deformation dataset for 3D components (Beam and frame components). If you need the data, you can obtain it via email at zhaozhiwei@nuaa.edu.cn.

## Train

Here are the training program. Once the dataset is prepared, you can run train.py using the following command: 
 ```bash
    python train.py
 ```
